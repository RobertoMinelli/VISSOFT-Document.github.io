<p>Software visualization is a broad research area whose general goal is to enhance and promote the theory, realization, and evaluation of approaches to visually encode and analyze software systems, including software development practices, evolution, structure, and software runtime behavior. Software visualization is inherently interdisciplinary, drawing on theories and techniques from areas such as information visualization, human-computer interaction, computer graphics, and data science, and applying these in the software engineering domain.</p>

<p>The VISSOFT conference is principally a venue for publishing and discussing research related to software visualization. Consequently, VISSOFT brings together a community of researchers from software engineering, information visualization, human-computer interaction, computer graphics, and data science to discuss theoretical foundations, algorithms, techniques, tools, and applications related to software visualization.</p>


<p>VISSOFT, co-located with ICSME, encourages a variety of submissions that address outstanding challenges in software systems using visualization. This includes technical papers, evaluations, and papers that present novel ideas and tools.</p>

<div class="panel panel-default">
    <div class="panel-heading">
      <h3 class="panel-title">Topics of interest include but are not limited to:</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
    <ul>
          <li>Innovative visualization and visual analytics techniques for the analysis of software engineering data. This includes source code, dependencies, repositories, developer social networks like StackOverflow and GitHub, mobile app reviews, documentation, runtime logs, and DevOps data.</li>
          <li>Visualization to support software development activities, including design, requirements engineering, software maintenance, program comprehension, software performance, software testing, and debugging.</li>
          <li>Interaction techniques and algorithms for software visualization.</li>
          <li>Visualization-based techniques in software engineering education.</li>
          <li>Integration of software visualization tools with development environments.</li>
          <li>Empirical evaluation of software visualizations, including eye-tracking.</li>
          <li>Industrial experience with using software visualization.</li>
          <li>Applications of new technologies to enhance software visualization, including virtual reality, augmented reality, gamification, and machine learning.</li>
          <li>Analytical approaches to understanding software-related aspects based on data science concepts.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>We solicit papers that present original, unpublished research results. Papers will be rigorously reviewed by an international program committee. In addition to full technical papers, VISSOFT features a New Ideas and Emerging Results and Tool Demo (NIER/TD) track whose purpose is to present an idea still under development or to demonstrate the functionality of a newly developed tool. All accepted submissions will appear in the conference proceedings and the IEEE Digital Library.</p>

  <div class="panel-body">
  	<p>A technical paper contribution must describe an in-depth and mature research result relevant to software visualization. The content of a technical paper can be a maximum of 10 pages long (including all figures, tables, and appendices). However, the 10-page limit does not include the bibliography, which is limited by two additional pages.</p>

  	<p>The submission of a video (up to 5 minutes in length) to accompany the paper is highly encouraged to show interaction possibilities. Authors who wish to submit a video should add a URL to the video at the end of the abstract (e.g., Video URL: https://youtu.be/XXX).</p>

  	<p>Authors of technical papers that do not receive an acceptance recommendation from reviewers can, eventually, be invited to adapt the paper and make it acceptable for the NIER/TD track.</p>

  	<p><b>Paper Awards: </b> VISSOFT 2022 will award the best technical papers.</p>

  	<p><b>Artifact Evaluation:</b> Paper authors are encouraged to submit research artifacts (e.g., tools, data repositories, frameworks, videos) for evaluation. For more details, please refer to the <a href="submission.html#artifact">Artifact Track.</a></p>

    	<p>The NIER/TD Track of VISSOFT accepts two types of submissions: NIER (New Ideas and Emerging Results) and Tool Demonstrations (TD). Both NIER and TD contributions have a page limit of 5 (including bibliography).</p>

    	<p>NIER contributions describe work-in-progress and preliminary, exciting results. Authors are encouraged to include open questions and even provocative hypotheses to get early feedback on their research ideas. A sound evaluation is not required for NIER contributions. One of the goals of the NIER Track is to foster collaboration among different research groups.</p>

    	<p>Tool Demonstrations (TD) describe the design or actual utilization of software visualization tools, with a focus on the architecture of the tool or its use to gain new insights. During the conference, we will organize an informal tool demonstration session where authors of TD papers are invited to demonstrate their tools. The submission may also contain a link to a screencast (e.g., YouTube or Vimeo) to show the interaction possibilities offered by the tool.</p>
